# About

I am a Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), supervised by [Professor Katrin Erk](http://www.katrinerk.com).

My research is in natural language processing (NLP), focusing on computational semantics. Currently I am working on how implicit arguments of events can be inferred from narrative coherence, and how such knowledge can be applied to end tasks that require complex reasoning, like reading comprehension.

Before coming to UT Austin, I obtained my B.Eng. in Automation, and B.Econ. in Economics (double degree), both from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn).
