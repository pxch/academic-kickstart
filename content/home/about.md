# About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu), advised by [Professor Katrin Erk](http://www.katrinerk.com).

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on computational semantics. I am particularly interested in different approaches of integrating structural semantic knowledge into end-to-end neural models for better semantic understanding and reasoning.

Before coming to UT Austin, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), majoring in Automation and Economics.
